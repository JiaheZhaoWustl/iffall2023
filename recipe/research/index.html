        Pi Du Mian, or Nanjing-Style Pork Skin Noodles, is a savory and slightly spicy noodle dish crafted with ingredients such as pork skin, noodles, bok choy, and an array of delightful garnishes. It holds a cherished place in the hearts of Nanjing locals, representing a beloved local delicacy. The recipe for this dish varies widely across households and street food vendors, each offering its unique twist. Here, the version I'm sharing is the one Iâ€™m most familiar with growing up.

        This particular culinary tradition holds a special place in my hometown, which is why most of the available references are in Chinese. The recipe is a culmination of information gathered from various sources, as different families have their unique ways of preparing these noodles. I have taken on the task of translating these Chinese sources into the recipe and description, though it's important to note that some nuances may be lost in translation.
