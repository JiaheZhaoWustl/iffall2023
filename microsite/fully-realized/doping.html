                    <p><b class="strong">A</b>rmstrong was embroiled in a series of allegations and legal battles related to doping throughout his career. Persistent accusations of doping plagued him, which he consistently denied, often citing a lack of positive drug test results.</p><br>
                    <p>Armstrong's critics, such as Paul Kimmage and Christophe Bassons, accused him of being a hindrance to efforts against doping in the sport. Bassons, who was known for his anti-doping stance, had a public altercation with Armstrong during the 1999 Tour de France, where Armstrong questioned his outspokenness on the issue.</p><br>
                    <p>Despite ongoing allegations, Armstrong vehemently denied using illegal performance-enhancing drugs for four more years, highlighting his extensive testing history. He even worked with controversial trainer Michele Ferrari, which drew significant criticism. Although Armstrong later claimed to have severed ties with Ferrari, USADA's report suggested an ongoing professional relationship with the trainer.</p><br>

                    <p><b class="strong">I</b>n 2004, allegations of Armstrong's doping were published in the book "L.A. Confidentiel," where his former soigneur Emma O'Reilly claimed a backdated prescription for cortisone was produced to avoid a positive test in 1999. Armstrong sued for libel, settling the case with an apology from the newspaper.</p><br>
                    <p>In 2005, L'Ã‰quipe reported that retested urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France showed Armstrong's positive results for EPO, a claim he vehemently denied.</p><br>
                    <p>Armstrong faced a federal investigation, a whistleblower lawsuit by Floyd Landis, and a lawsuit by Acceptance Insurance Company (AIC) over bonus repayments. He initially fought the federal inquiry but later admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2013.</p><br>
                    <p>USADA charged Armstrong with running a massive doping ring and banned him from professional cycling for life, stripping him of his seven Tour de France titles.</p><br>
                    <p>In 2018, Armstrong settled the lawsuit with the US government, agreeing to pay $5 million, with a significant portion going to Floyd Landis for his role as a whistleblower.</p><br>
                    <p>These allegations and legal battles had far-reaching consequences for Armstrong, including the loss of sponsors and a tarnished reputation in professional cycling.</p><br>
