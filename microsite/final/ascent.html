                    <p><b class="strong">O</b>n October 2, 1996, Lance Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer that had already metastasized malignantly, spreading to his lungs and brain. In later interviews, his doctor revealed that his chances of survival at the time were "almost non-existent." They told Lance he had a 20% to 50% chance, mainly to give him hope. But with his type of cancer, X-ray tests and blood work showed very little hope. In commemoration of this day, Nike later launched the "10//2" merchandise series, with a portion of the proceeds going to the Lance Armstrong Foundation established in 1997. After undergoing surgery to remove his right testicle and the affected part of his brain, Armstrong underwent a series of chemotherapy treatments at Indiana University Medical Center.

                    <p>In 1998, Lance Armstrong's cycling comeback faced initial challenges, as he struggled to compete at an elite level in races like Paris-Nice, prompting thoughts of retirement. However, he relocated to North Carolina to train with former Tour de France rider Bob Roll and others, finding renewed determination. During this time, he organized charity events for cancer research, including the Race for the Roses in Austin, Texas, where notable cyclists like Greg LeMond, Sean Kelly, and Miguel Induráin attended. Armstrong expressed admiration for Laurent Jalabert during this period.</p><br>

His success earned him recognition and he finished 3rd in the voting for the Vélo d'Or.</p><br>
                    <p>In 1999, Armstrong achieved his breakthrough by winning the Tour de France, with significant stage victories. He dominated the race, beating his closest rival, Alex Zülle, by a substantial margin. The absence of Jan Ullrich and Marco Pantani during this tour meant Armstrong had yet to prove himself against some of the sport's biggest names.</p><br>

                    <p>In 2001, Armstrong continued his dominance, beating Ullrich by 6 minutes and 44 seconds. The following year, Ullrich was absent due to suspension, allowing Armstrong to secure victory by a seven-minute margin over Joseba Beloki. During key stages, Armstrong's US Postal team, led by Vuelta champion Roberto Heras, played a crucial role in securing his wins, particularly on challenging climbs.</p><br>
                    <p>In 2003, Lance Armstrong continued his dominant streak by winning his fifth consecutive Tour de France, with Jan Ullrich finishing second. Their battle was incredibly close, with only a minute and a second separating them in Paris. Armstrong's U.S. Postal team won the team time trial, and he nearly crashed out of the Tour while defending the yellow jersey on stage 9. During a treacherous descent, Armstrong narrowly avoided a crash when Joseba Beloki fell violently. In doing so, Armstrong went off the road onto a foot trail but managed to keep upright, picking up his bike and continuing without losing time. Armstrong maintained a slim 21-second lead over Alexander Vinokourov, while Ullrich emerged as his main challenger. Armstrong secured stage 15 after an incident when a spectator's bag caught his handlebar.</p><br>

He finished 6 minutes and 19 seconds ahead of Andreas Klöden, with Ullrich coming in fourth. Armstrong won a record-breaking five individual stages and the team time trial. He also achieved a remarkable feat by winning three consecutive mountain stages and excelled in individual time trials. His victory on the famous Alpe d'Huez climb showcased his exceptional riding skills as he overtook Basso. Armstrong also won sprint finishes and the final individual time trial, completing a record-breaking number of stage wins.</p><br>
                    <p>In 2005, Lance Armstrong faced strong competition, narrowly losing the stage 1 time trial to David Zabriskie by just two seconds, despite passing Jan Ullrich. His Discovery Channel team excelled in the team time trial, and Armstrong clinched victory in the final individual time trial. Throughout the mountain stages, he faced challenges from Ivan Basso, Jan Ullrich, Andreas Klöden, Alexandre Vinokourov, and former teammate Levi Leipheimer. Armstrong skillfully defended his lead and, at times, even extended it. On July 24, he made history by winning his seventh consecutive Tour de France, finishing 4 minutes and 40 seconds ahead of Basso, with Ullrich in third place.</p><br>
                    <p>In the same year, Armstrong announced his retirement from professional cycling, citing a desire to spend more time with his family and his foundation. During his retirement, he briefly rekindled his connection to cycling when he witnessed Carlos Sastre's victory on Alpe d'Huez at a conference in 2008.   </p><br>
