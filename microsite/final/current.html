                    ollowing the Lance Armstrong scandal and in order to combat doping in the Tour de France, several new rules and procedures were introduced. These rules are integrated with the current testing procedure to ensure fair and clean competition:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li class="listItem">More Stringent Testing: The Tour de France has increased the frequency and rigor of drug testing. After each stage, the overall leader, the stage winner, and two riders chosen at random are tested. This helps to deter doping by directly targeting top performers and randomly selecting others.</li>
                    <li class="listItem">Random Testing: In addition to the specific tests after each stage, random testing can be conducted at any point during the race. This unpredictability discourages riders from attempting to manipulate the testing schedule.</li>
                    <li class="listItem">Team-Based Testing: Many teams have their own drug testing programs to uphold their reputation. Teams like Quick-Step have taken proactive measures by conducting tests on their riders independently. This internal oversight helps maintain the image of the team and ensures a clean culture within the squad.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="guess">ANTI-DRUG</div>
            </div>
            <div class="left right">
                <div>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li class="listItem">Pre-Race Testing: All riders are subjected to drug tests before the start of the race, usually on the first day's stage, which is often a short time-trial. This pre-race testing sets the tone for clean competition from the very beginning.</li>
                        <li class="listItem">Whereabouts System: Riders are required to provide their whereabouts information, allowing anti-doping agencies to locate them for testing. This system helps ensure that riders are accessible for testing even when not competing.</li>
                        <li class="listItem">Off-Season Testing: To maintain the integrity of the sport, testing is not limited to the race itself. Off-season testing can also occur, ensuring that riders stay clean year-round.</li>
                        <li class="listItem">Immediate Consequences: Riders who test positive for prohibited substances face immediate consequences, including disqualification from the race. This swift action sends a strong message against doping.</li>
                    </ul>
