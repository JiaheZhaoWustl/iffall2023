                    ollowing the Lance Armstrong scandal and in order to combat
                    doping in the Tour de France, several new rules and procedures were
                    introduced. These rules are integrated with the current testing
                    procedure to ensure fair and clean competition:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li class="listItem">More Stringent Testing: The Tour de France has increased thefrequency and rigor of drug testing. After each stage, the overallleader, the stage winner, and two riders chosen at random aretested. This helps to deter doping by directly targeting topperformers and randomly selecting others.</li>
                    <li class="listItem">Random Testing: In addition to the specific tests after each stagerandom testing can be conducted at any point during the race.This unpredictability discourages riders from attempting tomanipulate the testing schedule.</li>
                    <li class="listItem">Team-Based Testing: Many teams have their own drug testingprograms to uphold their reputation. Teams like Quick-Step havetaken proactive measures by conducting tests on their ridersindependently. This internal oversight helps maintain the image ofthe team and ensures a clean culture within the squad.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="left right">
                <div>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li class="listItem">Pre-Race Testing: All riders are subjected to drug tests before thestart of the race, usually on the first day's stage, which is often ashort time-trial. This pre-race testing sets the tone for cleancompetition from the very beginning.</li>
                        <li class="listItem">Whereabouts System: Riders are required to provide theirwhereabouts information, allowing anti-doping agencies to locatethem for testing. This system helps ensure that riders areaccessible for testing even when not competing.Off-Season Testing: To maintain the integrity of the sport, testing isnot limited to the race itself. Off-season testing can also occur,ensuring that riders stay clean year-round.</li>
                        <li class="listItem">lmmediate Consequences: Riders who test positive for prohibitedsubstances face immediate consequences, includingdisqualification from the race. This swift action sends a strongmessage against doping.</li>
