                    <p>Armstrong's critics, such as Paul Kimmage and Christophe Bassonsaccused him of being a hindrance to efforts against doping in thesport. Bassons, who was known for his anti-doping stance, had apublic altercation with Armstrong during the 1999 Tour de France,where Armstrong questioned his outspokenness on the issue.</p><br>
                    <p>Despite ongoing allegations, Armstrong vehemently denied usingillegal performance-enhancing drugs for four more years, highlightinghis extensive testing history. He even worked with controversialtrainer Michele Ferrari, which drew significant criticism. AlthoughArmstrong later claimed to have severed ties with Ferrari, USADA'Sreport suggested an ongoing professional relationship with thetrainer.</p><br>

                    <p><b class="strong">I</b>n 2004, allegations of Armstrong's doping were published in thebook "L.A. Confidentiel," where his former soigneur Emma O'Reillyclaimed a backdated prescription for cortisone was produced to avoida positive test in 1999. Armstrong sued for libel, settling the case withan apology from the newspaper.</p><br>
                    <p>In 2005, LEquipe reported that retested urine samples from the 1999Tour de France showed Armstrong's positive results for EPO, a claimhe vehemently denied.</p><br>
                    <p>Armstrong faced a federal investigation, a whistleblower lawsuit byFloyd Landis, and a lawsuit by Acceptance Insurance Company (AlC)over bonus repayments. He initially fought the federal inquiry butlater admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2013.</p><br>
                    <p>USADA charged Armstrong with running a massive doping ring andbanned him from professional cycling for life, stripping him of hisseven Tour de France titles.</p><br>
                    <p>In 2018, Armstrong settled the lawsuit with the US government,agreeing to pay $5 million, with a significant portion going to FloydLandis for his role as a whistleblower.</p><br>
                    <p>These allegations and legal battles had far-reaching consequences forArmstrong, including the loss of sponsors and a tarnished reputationin professional cycling.</p><br>
